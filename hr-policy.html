EMPLOYEE RELATIONS</h3><h4>&nbsp;11.1&nbsp;Discipline</h4><h5>&nbsp;Policy Statement</h5><p>XAVOC TECHNOCRATS PVT. LTD. has a human resources’ strategy that recognises the value of its people. Part of this strategy is the fair treatment of all employees. This requires a minimum standard of conduct and performance be agreed, set and communicated with all employees. If employees do not meet this standard, appropriate corrective action, such as training, should be undertaken. Discipline should only be engaged with an employee on a performance issue if all other corrective action has failed to achieve the desired result.</p><p>Where an employee has deliberately breached a Company policy or procedure, or engaged in misconduct, disciplinary procedures should be initiated.</p><p>Employees should be treated fairly and the proper procedures should be followed.</p><p>Employees must be made aware of their responsibilities, counselled and given the opportunity to reach the standards expected of them and the chance to defend themselves before action is taken.</p><p>It is a requirement to have a third party attend a disciplinary meeting, and notes taken be signed as a true record of discussions.</p><p>The expected standard must be clearly defined and the measurement criteria understood. A reasonable date for achievement of standards must be agreed. This should be shown as a minimum time, e.g. within one month.</p><p>For serious issues, employees must be advised in writing and such advice should be recorded on the employee’s personnel file.</p><h5>Process<br></h5><ul><li>Poor Performance<br>Wherever possible the Performance Management System should be used to manage employee performance.&nbsp; However, there may be times when performance, conduct or employee attitude need to be immediately addressed.<br><br>If employees fall below required performance standards and performance management processes have not been adequate to address the issue they must be personally counselled and then given written confirmation of their deficiencies in performance (a written warning).<br><br>Such written warnings must clearly define the deficiency, the expected standard, by when it should be achieved, how the company will help the employee achieve the improvement required and the consequences of failing to do so.<br><br>A record of all meetings, training and/or coaching given and a summary of discussions must be kept by the manager concerned and a copy placed on the employee’s personnel file. This should include date, location and time of discussion.<br><br>If an employee consistently fails to meet agreed standards, he/she has been counselled and appropriate support/training has been offered and/or given, then further action is required. This may lead to the employee being dismissed.<br><br>If an employee has not been performing as required, and:<ul><li>all possible corrective action, including training and coaching, has been undertaken</li><li>the manager concerned has documentation showing the conversations taken place, agreed action plans, and other communication with the employee</li><li>the employee has been informed of the standards required and his/her performance deficiency(ies) with action plans in writing on at least two occasions and the consequences of failing to meet the required standards</li><li>the employee has been given the opportunity to appeal or respond to the issues highlighted on each occasion</li><li>no other suitable option, or other appropriate positions, are available</li></ul></li></ul><p style="padding-left: 30px;" data-mce-style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;If all these processes have been followed and the employee’s performance still has not improved, then the employee may be dismissed*.</p><ul><li>Misconduct<br><br>Managers are expected to investigate misconduct and proceed through the following steps:<ul><li>a verbal warning should be given to an employee for minor misconduct. A record of the warning must be kept by the manager and should be signed by the employee. The employee must be given the opportunity to respond</li><li>if the unacceptable behaviour continues, a written warning will be issued, and signed by the employee as being received and understood. The employee must be given the opportunity to respond</li><li>a second written warning should be given to an employee if he/she requires further discipline for the same or a related issue, and also signed by the employee as being received and understood. The employee must be given the opportunity to respond</li><li>employees who have been disciplined three times are subject to dismissal*</li><li>details of disciplinary actions should be recorded on the employee’s personnel file and removed after six months if further disciplinary action is not required</li></ul></li></ul><p style="padding-left: 30px;" data-mce-style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;If a manager considers the allegation to be serious, and it requires further investigation, an employee should be suspended on base pay for a maximum of two weeks while an investigation takes place. The individual must be informed, in writing, of the details of the allegation and advised he/she is under investigation. The employee must sign this notice as being received and understood.</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;" data-mce-style="padding-left: 30px;">This letter should invite the employee to present his/her version of events to the investigating officer and inform he/she may be accompanied by a representative.&nbsp; The only purpose of the representative’s visit is to observe – they are not participants.</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;" data-mce-style="padding-left: 30px;">Should we consider an employee’s conduct likely to lead to a situation in which we may wish to dismiss without notice, a diary must be kept at all times to record incidents and conversations and associated matters which may be needed in subsequent proceedings. The relevant manager is responsible for keeping this diary. This manager should also issue a written warning that a continuance of such behaviour will lead to instant dismissal.</p><ul><li>Gross or Serious Misconduct<br><br>Summary (instant) dismissal for gross or very serious misconduct is possible (depending on the facts involved) for the following: insubordination, drunkenness, dishonesty, assault, deliberately endangering the safety of others, commission of a criminal offence on our site, and objectionable language**. Managers must, however, consult with senior management prior to taking this action*.<br><br>In such cases follow the procedure below:<ul><li>investigate the alleged offence thoroughly, including talking to witnesses, if any</li><li>ask the employee for his/her response to the allegation (taking notes of this discussion)</li><li>consult with the next most senior manager regarding possible action</li><li>if still appropriate, following a thorough investigation, terminate/dismiss the employee</li><li>keep a file on all evidence collected and action taken in these circumstances</li></ul></li></ul><p style="padding-left: 30px;" data-mce-style="padding-left: 30px;">&nbsp;All procedures must be followed in accordance with employment equal opportunity/anti-discrimination legislation.</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p style="padding-left: 30px;" data-mce-style="padding-left: 30px;">*Note: In all such cases ‘procedural fairness’ guidelines will apply. This means the warning and dismissal process must allow the employee to offer their view of the events concerned. The employee must have every chance to defend himself/herself and has the right to appeal a decision made. If this process is not followed the dismissal may be overturned by an Human Resource authority.&nbsp;</p><p style="padding-left: 30px;" data-mce-style="padding-left: 30px;">**Note: For some offences XAVOC TECHNOCRATS PVT. LTD. retains the right to report the matter to the police where charges may be laid.&nbsp; The police will be notified with regard to any criminal act against the Company or another member of staff.&nbsp; Management has a duty of care to shareholders and staff and at all times will be subordinate to legal process.</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><h4>11.2 Disciplinary Appeal</h4><h5>Policy Statement</h5><p>During all stages of the disciplinary process employees have the right to appeal against any disciplinary action taken against them.</p><p>An employee who believes the disciplinary action taken against them is unfair, is able to appeal the process.</p><p>An appeal will be treated fairly, dealt with discreetly and actioned promptly.</p><p>This policy should be read in conjunction with the grievance policy.</p><h5>Process<br></h5><p>An employee is entitled to lodge a written appeal to their supervisor’s manager detailing his/her objections to the disciplinary action within three working days of notification.</p><p>Managers should:</p><ul><li>acknowledge receipt of the employee’s objection</li><li>investigate the matter thoroughly</li><li>report back to the employee within seven days</li></ul><p>If the appeal is disallowed an employee is entitled to appeal to the next most senior manager.</p><p>The next most senior manager should investigate the matter and report back to the employee within 10 working days.</p><p>The employee has no further right of appeal under this process if the second appeal is disallowed.</p><p>All procedures must be followed in accordance with employment equal opportunity/anti-discrimination legislation.</p><h4>11.3 Grievance</h4><h5>Policy Statement</h5><p>XAVOC TECHNOCRATS PVT. LTD. supports the right of every employee to lodge a grievance with his/her manager if the individual believes a decision, behaviour or action that affects their employment is unfair. We aim to resolve problems and grievances promptly and as close to the source as possible with graduated steps for further discussions and resolution at higher levels of authority as necessary.</p><p>Grievances should be actioned discreetly and promptly dealt with in an objective manner.</p><h5>Process</h5><p>The employee should attempt to resolve the complaint as close to the source as possible. This can be at a quite informal and verbal level. If the matter is not resolved then further steps need to be taken.</p><p>All available attempts to settle a grievance before starting the formal grievance process should be taken.</p><p>For the formal grievance process to begin, complainants must fully describe their grievance in writing, including dates and locations wherever possible and the remedies sought.</p><p>The person(s) against whom the grievance/complaint is made should be given the full details of the allegation(s) against them and should have the opportunity and reasonable time to respond before resolution is attempted.

A grievance taken to this level must be in writing from the employee.</p><p>The employee’s manager will forward to the Managing Director any additional information thought relevant. The Managing Director will provide a written response to the employee and also communicate with any other parties involved.</p><p>If the matter is still not resolved, the employee will be advised of his/her rights to pursue the matter with external authorities if they wish.</p><p>In some circumstances, it may not be appropriate for an employee to discuss his/her grievance with the immediate manager. Grievances relating to harassment would fall into this category and an employee should be able to make their approach to a more senior manager.</p><p>All procedures must be followed in accordance with employment equal opportunity/anti-discrimination legislation.</p><p>The above procedure takes place for individual employee grievances. Whatever the final outcome, it will affect the attitudes of each party and their long-term relationship. The issues which sparked the grievance should be reviewed by management at executive level so the dispute does not reoccur.</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><h3>12.
